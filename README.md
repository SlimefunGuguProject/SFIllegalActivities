# SFDrugs
This is a Slimefun addon, for 1.19.2+.
I've added support for 1.20.1.

There is a progressive
story line to this plugin. This plugin will occassionally
spawn incredibly difficult bosses at a 1/20 chance each spawn.
If you feel like this is too high, too bad, because I can't
figure out how to use the config.yml.

## FAQ
# How do I get started?

A: Create a Compounder. Everything you need
to create drugs come from the compounder.

# How do I get the Corporate gear?
A: Trade with the Mysterious Trader for Blueprints,
then make a Trading Terminal. You can craft it
in there.

# How do I progress past making Methamphetamine?
A: Create cyanide, then make the wooden hoe.
Right click, then it spawns a rudementary trader, which you can
get items from. 

# How can I get boss drops?
A: Defeat the respective bosses. The Red Wolves Hook drops from the Red Wolves Gangster,
while the Android core drops from the Corporation Security Robots. You can also get
the Robot armor set from the Corporate Security Robots, which is much more powerful
than the Hazmat set, while much rarer.


# Where can I go to suggest new additions?
A: Either create a pull request, or shoot me a DM. My discord "key" thing is sniperkaos, just let me know you're
talking to me about the plugin.
